    <br> <br>
    Dearest Sir, <br>
    <p>
        This is to inform you that a flourishing started named <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.devsnest.in/"><strong>Devsnest</strong></a> is organising a <em>30-days Bootcamp</em> for
        students across
        India & me along with some other students have joined it to sharpen our coding as well as problem solving
        skills. <br>
        This is going to be a <strong>6 months program</strong> where we will be learning two very important skills for
        any student to get a <em>good placement.</em><br><br>
        These skills include: <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>DS/Algo(Problem solving skills)</li>
        <li>Web Development using <em>MERN Stack</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The duration of the program has been divided as follows:</p>

    <table border="2px" align="center">
        <tr>
            <th>Topic</th>
            <th>Duration</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>DS/Algo(Problem solving skills)</td>
            <td>2 Months</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Web Development using <em>MERN Stack</em></td>
            <td>4 Months</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        I therefore request you to kindly allow some relaxation from hefty assignments for this 6 month period so that i
        can focus completely on learnig these important skills. I assure you that i will be regular with all my other
        course subjects and will dedicate appropriate time for them as well. <br><br>
        Hope that you will understand the importance of this program and allow the relaxation. <br><br>
        Yours sincerely, <br> Rohan Singh <br>B.Tech-CSE 3rd yr. <br> Imperial College of Engineering <br> Noida
